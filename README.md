# Python Project: Instacart

The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and theyâ€™re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products

## Objective:
Instacart's marketing team would like to uncover more information about their sales patterns. We were tasked to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.  The goal being to provide the following:

Provide the marketing team with key data and patterns.  This includes what the busiest times of the day are, which day of the week sees the most activity, how customer loyalty measures up, etc.

Analyze the data to discover user's spending habits and identify if they can be attributed to certain characteristics, including but not limited to their income, marital status, family size, region, etc).

Identify spending habits and develop marketing strategies based on the behaviors of certain characteristics.  This includes identifying and grouping products from various price points and their popularity among individuals based on the aforementioned characteristics.
