# Python Project: Instacart

The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and theyâ€™re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products

## Objective:
Instacart's marketing team would like to uncover more information about their sales patterns. We were tasked to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.  The goal being to provide the following:

Analyze the data to answer questions from marketing and sales teams (for example, busiest time of day,highest grossing days of the week, most loyal customers, etc.).

Analyze the data to discover differences in user's ordering habits based various characteristics (such as region, income, loyalty status, etc.).

Create customer profiles based on combinations of variables and analyze how their ordering behaviors may differ (for instance: pet owners, vegetarian/vegan, etc.).
